# Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone

The game is a Frogger-clone. The game's goal is to reach the top of the board while **avoiding the enemies** crossing along the road.


When the player reaches water blocks or when he has been hit by one of the enemies crossing, the player position will be *reset* to his initial state. The player should use the **arrow keys** in order to move.
